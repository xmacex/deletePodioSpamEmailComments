# deletePodioSpamEmailComments

A JavaScript cleaning routine for cleaning Podio spam comments sent via the Email to item feature

Super annoying that [Podio](https://podio.com) has weak or nonexisting spam protection, and does not allow disabling this feature per user or altogether for a workspace.

## Usage

This is used by logging in to Podio as the user, while setting `spamUid`, and copy+pasting the whole lot to browser console, and then waiting.
